## 3. Keyword Gaps (Opportunities)

### Missing or weak
1. **Daily challenge** – You have the feature but don’t use the term in content.
2. **Leaderboard** – You have it; add it to meta/body copy.
3. **Hints / auto-hints** – Strong differentiator; use in meta and headings.
4. **No download / browser** – Partially covered; could be stronger.
5. **Mobile / tablet** – Present in FAQ; add to meta/headings.
6. **Shanghai solitaire** – Alternative name; add to keywords and content.
7. **8 layouts / difficulty levels** – You have more than 5; update “5 levels” to match reality.

### Overuse / redundancy
- “mahjong solitaire” is well placed; avoid stuffing.
- “free” appears often; natural but monitor for overuse.
